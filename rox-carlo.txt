[06:45] roxana (roxanared): Hello Sir
[06:46] roxana (roxanared): how are you?
[06:46] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I've been better, my manager is AWOL.
[06:46] roxana (roxanared): hmmm that is inconvenient
[06:46] roxana (roxanared): my friend is in prison, so i'm not feeling so great either
[06:47] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): You had a run in with her, you wouldn't know anything about that would you?
[06:47] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I'm sorry for your friend, but she robbed the bank.
[06:47] roxana (roxanared): she tried to kill me by the docks after i refused to work for her
[06:47] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Yes, I understand that was a few days ago.
[06:48] roxana (roxanared): my friend lily was just in time to save me
[06:48] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) nod "and then she robbed a bank. I get it."
[06:48] roxana (roxanared): and took drastic measures by locking your killer manager inside the vault
[06:48] roxana (roxanared): lily never robbed the bank, she used the vault as a make shift prison
[06:48] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): After taking the money. I know the story darlin'.
[06:48] roxana (roxanared): i have no idea where the money is
[06:49] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) laughed "she took the money, doll, she robbed the bank."
[06:49] roxana (roxanared): now, my Master is very pissed off his best and most profitable slave is behind bars. also lily was new to him
[06:50] roxana (roxanared): so lily needs to be released from prison and i believe you might have connections to make that happen
[06:50] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Ok. I can see him being pissed off. You know I tried to talk to him when he was here, his friend the cop wouldn't let me.
[06:50] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) shook his head "Hmm...the high court has already issued her sentence, no way I can get a court order overturned."
[06:52] roxana (roxanared): it could be wise for you to reach out to him yourself
[06:52] roxana (roxanared): his name is rubi.chun
[06:52] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I certainly will. I know who he is and where he works. I did my research. So where's my manger?>
[06:52] roxana (roxanared): sorry to hear that court order can't be overturned
[06:53] roxana (roxanared): it might be best to reach out to my Master, He might be able to help you find her
[06:53] roxana (roxanared) puts on an igorant innocent face
[06:53] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): So he has her - is taht what you're telling me?
[06:53] roxana (roxanared): i'm not saying anything good Sir
[06:54] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) stood and moved to block the girl from getting from the booth "Does he have Lusi?"
[06:54] roxana (roxanared): perhaps you haven't looked at the right places, who knows what lusi is up to
[06:54] roxana (roxanared) scans the room for a way out
[06:55] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) leaned in "does he have Lusi? It would be better for you to answer. I have good methods for extracting information"
[06:55] roxana (roxanared): look, i don't know where your manager is, i heard she was asking questions about him on some sim he frequents
[06:55] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Answer the question, girl
[06:55] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Does

[06:55] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Lusi
[06:55] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): ?
[06:55] roxana (roxanared): i suggest you move away, this conversation is over
[06:56] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): It is NOT over
[06:56] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) reached to grab the girl by the hair
[06:56] roxana (roxanared): ask Master, i don't know that, He doens't tell me everything
[06:56] roxana (roxanared): ouch LET GO!!!
[06:56] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) yanked her to the end of the booth "how important are YOU to him I wonder"
[06:56] roxana (roxanared): i'm staff, not a whore
[06:57] roxana (roxanared): look this is not right, i came here to talk in a decent matter to you
[06:57] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) laughed "you act like I care" he yanked the hair again, pulling her out of the booth
[06:57] roxana (roxanared): this aggression is unwanted for
[06:57] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I don't give a shit, you won't answer any of my questions nicely, so we do it the hard way
[06:58] roxana (roxanared): look, i'll ask around to see if He has her
[06:58] roxana (roxanared): i'm telling you what i know Sir
[06:58] roxana (roxanared): let go of me, and i'll find out more
[06:58] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I'm not convinced
[06:58] roxana (roxanared): i'll call you as soon as i know more
[06:58] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) pulled her out the door by the hair knowing good and well the cops are looking the other way
[06:59] roxana (roxanared): i want hostilities to end
[07:01] roxana (roxanared): look i haven't seen Him today and last nght
[07:01] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) dragged her through the streets to an old building and tossed her down the stairs to the basement
[07:01] roxana (roxanared): i will find out for you, i promise
[07:01] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I don't trust that you won't run and never return, cunt
[07:01] roxana (roxanared): i know you can hurt my friend in prison through your friends, i don't want
[07:01] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) pulled his switch blade and snicked it open
[07:02] roxana (roxanared) gasps as she sees the knife
[07:02] roxana (roxanared): my friend is here, she's in jail, of course i will be here
[07:02] roxana (roxanared): i might even get a whoring license here
[07:02] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): I'll send that other Asian whore to him with a message, you better hope you are valuable to him
[07:03] roxana (roxanared): this is not right, i came here with the best of intentions
[07:03] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) starts to cut away at her dress
[07:03] roxana (roxanared): you agreed to a talk, this is overkill
[07:03] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): you won't even answer my questions
[07:03] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): You have zero good intentions
[07:03] roxana (roxanared): i don't know if he has her
[07:03] roxana (roxanared): i can find out for you
[07:04] roxana (roxanared): i know some of His associates, they will tell me
[07:04] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Why did you say it would be wise for me to reach out to him?
[07:04] roxana (roxanared): let me go, and meet me back here within the hour
[07:04] roxana (roxanared): i'll have the intel you need
[07:04] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) placed the flat of the blade on the girl's naked breast, the edge facing to the nipple "Why did you say it would be wise for me to reach out to him?"
[07:04] roxana (roxanared): to make a truce, cease fire
[07:05] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Are we at war?
[07:05] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): Does he have Lusi?
[07:05] roxana (roxanared): He might want to work with you in return for some help with lily's early release
[07:06] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) moved the knife so the sharp edge rested against the girl's nipple "Does he have Lusi?"
[07:06] roxana (roxanared): honestly, i don't know Sir, but i can find out for you
[07:06] roxana (roxanared): i'll be back within the hour with the information, i assure you
[07:06] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) sawed the blade back and forth, the edge barely touched the nipple, not enough to cut it, yet "you're lying to me"
[07:07] roxana (roxanared) cries "no really Sir, i would tell you if i knew"
[07:08] Vanessa (ninie.biscuit) is online.
[07:08] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) shook his head "see.. this is the thing, I dont' believe you" he flicked the knife, causing a tiny little cut at the top of the nipple, just enough so some blood would be visible, not even enough to leave a scar
[07:08] roxana (roxanared): please i just want everyone to get along and work together and make money
[07:08] roxana (roxanared): let me find out for you, so we can stop this madness
[07:08] roxana (roxanared) screams out loud, feeling the knife cut
[07:09] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) looked at his watch "I will give you one half hour. If you are not back by then, you'd be better of  if I NEVER see your face again"
[07:09] Maxi Melody entered the region (173.66 m).
[07:10] roxana (roxanared): thank you Sir, i won't let you down
[07:10] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco) lifted the knife and placed the flat of the blade on her cheek "an ugly whore doesn't make much money, you know"
[07:11] roxana (roxanared) nods and turns around on her heels 
[07:12] Carlo Negulesco (carloantonio.negulesco): "30 minutes" he called to her
